# Fighting Days

![image](/images/ahaa.png)

Here I will explain the process of solving the assignment given as my first-year exam, the "Fighting Days" project. The task involved applying the skills acquired over the first year of studies, including planning, designing, creating a blog using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and testing it on users.

## Description

To commence the project, I carefully reviewed the assignment requirements and organized tasks using a Trello board for efficient planning and task management.
After setting up the Trello board, I decided to create a blog focusing on various martial art styles. Given my interest in martial arts, this topic seemed engaging. I collected images from the web and obtained text descriptions for the images from ChatGPT, which were later imported into WordPress for easy retrieval.

The design phase involved using Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype. Drawing inspiration from reputable martial arts websites like MMA Junkie and Bloody Elbow, I initially experimented with various colors but eventually settled on a minimalist palette of red, pink, and white.

Upon completing the design, I transitioned to coding in VSCode. I started with the HTML and CSS for the landing page, dedicating more time to JavaScript, which I found more challenging. Notably, the contact validation form required implementing regular expressions, which was a learning curve.

The blog's dynamic content fetching from the WordPress API and the implementation of a carousel were particularly challenging aspects of the JavaScript coding. Despite the struggles, I managed to overcome these difficulties with persistent efforts.

User testing and feedback played a crucial role in refining the design. Changes were made based on user suggestions, including adjusting background colors and font sizes. Hotjar tracking and testing on different users, including family members, provided valuable insights.

The final steps involved checking the website on the WC3 validator and addressing contrast errors. The report encapsulates the entire process of planning, designing, and implementing the "Fighting Days" project.
